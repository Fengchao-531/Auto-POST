🔔 Product Update: Lightweight Invoice Flow 

We’ve released a new lightweight invoice flow demo page designed to simplify the full cycle from OTP verification to archiving.

What’s new:

Manual OTP Verification: One-time code required to start the process.

Preview Invoice: Inline display of an “Invoice Draft” for quick review.

Download Invoice: Save a local copy (demo: .txt; real-world: PDF).

Share & Archive: Flexible options to close the loop:

Sync to accounting systems (Xero / QuickBooks)

Email to customer (PDF delivery)

Archive to cloud (Google Drive / Dropbox)

Generate reimbursement summary (one-page overview)

Update contact details (store userId & invoice header)

We’d love to hear your feedback—especially on whether the final “Share & Archive” step feels natural after download.
